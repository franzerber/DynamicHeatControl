Smart Heat Pump Controller  

This project automates the operation of a heat pump system for domestic hot water production, using dynamic electricity pricing from aWATTar and real-time PV (photovoltaic) generation data.  
The system optimizes energy usage by determining the most cost-effective times to run the heat pump based on current energy prices and available solar energy.   
The goal is to maximize efficiency, reduce energy costs, and leverage renewable energy sources.
